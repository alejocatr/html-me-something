                <h2 class="intro">Miami Beach</h2>
                <p>Located on a barrier island and connected to the mainland by a series of bridges, Miami Beach is a mix of quiet neighborhoods, lively entertainment-focused areas, and long stretches of soft-sand beaches. For visitors, South Beach and the Art Deco Historic District, with pastel buildings from the 1930s and early 1940s sporting classic neon signs, is one of the main highlights. An expensive tourist district, this area features numerous beachfront restaurants, shops, hotels, and plenty of sunbathing opportunities. The most popular street in this area is Ocean Drive, a section of road located along the oceanfront and home to some beautiful Art Deco buildings. One block inland, running parallel with Ocean Drive, is Collins Avenue. Collins Avenue is actually State Road A1A and is the main oceanfront street in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Miami+Beach,+FL/@25.8101747,-80.2798945,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d9a6172bfeddb9:0x37be1741259463eb!8m2!3d25.790654!4d-80.1300455">Miami Beach</a>, joining numerous neighborhoods.

                 <h2>Art Deco Historic District</h2>
                 <p>Even if you have no interest in the beach, the Art Deco Historic District is worth a trip out to Miami Beach. This architectural style, popular in the 1930s and 40s, dominates the trendy South Beach neighborhood. These uniquely designed buildings, in a range of pastel colors and displaying large neon signs, were built following a devastating hurricane that struck in 1926. Many are hotels and restaurants, most of which have been beautifully restored. Along some of the main streets, awnings on the lower level of these buildings provide shade for outdoor dining areas. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Art+Deco+Historic+District/@25.7801945,-80.1385525,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d9b4926b0c5503:0x7aa29d5a95e9d414!8m2!3d25.7802788!4d-80.1303466">Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue</a> are the two main streets through the area.</p>

                 <h2>Everglades National Park</h2>
                 <p>Everglades National Park, just a short drive from Miami, protects one of Florida's most unique natural features. These swamplands, covering about 1.5 million acres, are home to alligators, crocodiles, snakes, and all kinds of birds. This whole area is essentially a shallow river flowing out to the ocean. Within the park is an informative Visitors Center, as well as walking trails and boardwalks for wildlife viewing. One of the most enjoyable ways for tourists to experience the Everglades is on an airboat tour. These high-speed boat trips take visitors out into the marshes and streams to see alligators and other wildlife. There are several operators in the area, but outside the park, that offer tours of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Everglades+National+Park/@25.3796805,-80.9639139,10.5z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1severglades+national+park!3m4!1s0x88d0a8307a6c05db:0xfe03e56762f3197!8m2!3d25.2866155!4d-80.8986509">Everglades</a>.</p>
